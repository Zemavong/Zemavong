### Welcome :raising_hand_man:

My name is Stepan, I am 24 years old. I've been doing web development for over a year. I want to tell about myself:
 
## :computer:	 Hard skills: 

  Proficient: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OOP. Sometimes write C# and GO. Constantly evolving, now I plan to learn basic design patterns and Laravel.

## :people_hugging:  Soft skills:
  I improve my communication skills through sports: I really like to play :volleyball: volleyball classics, and since it is a team sport, you often need to communicate with a team and distribute roles to achieve common goals. 

  I also used to teach computer graphics and teach people of all ages how to work with 3-D editors. It taught me how to express myself and work with people more effectively.

## :video_game: My hobby:
  I'm interested in games and making them. In my spare time I often dive into game engines (unity, godot, construct 2), create game prototypes, prescribe game mechanics, logic, physics, narrative, and so on.
